## Highlights

+ *[Balance Master]({{ "/images/20160207-BalanceMaster.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }})* (click to see) is a game simulating the real-life problem of multi-task
+ *[Survive!Cheetah]({{ "/images/20160207-SurviveCheetah.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }})* (click to see) is an update version of *Balance Master*

## Why create this game?

This is Week 1 assignment from the course [Introduction to Game Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-design).  The instructions are:

> This week you are asked to make a simple game on a single sheet of paper. Your game should include:
>
> 1. A clearly articulated goal, and
> 2. A degree of difficulty enhanced by chance and/or skill.
> 3. Additionally, you must keep the following limitations in mind:
>
> The game should all fit on one piece of paper, ideally letter-sized or A4 so people can print it out, if they wish.  The game should be a one-player game.  A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page.  The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice, which are an optional element you may include in your game. (If you don’t have dice, there are websites that can simulate dice rolls, such as [https://www.random.org/dice](https://www.random.org/dice) .)

I have been thinking about creating a game that helps people manage their life for a long time - *[Balance Master]({{ "/images/20160207-BalanceMaster.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }})* (click to see).  Because my boyfriend used to do a very bad job on keeping our relationship along with his study.  I think by playing a game, he may understand the core of the problem better and develop his own strategy to improve the situation.  

## How was the game developed?

I was inspired by simulation games like [Democracy 3](http://www.positech.co.uk/democracy3/), in which players can manipulate the elements of a system and see the effects along time - they need to balance everything.  And I think time-management is exactly about balancing.  This is my first try on game design, so Balance Master is surely imperfect.  An new version has been developed: *[Survive!Cheetah]({{ "/images/20160207-SurviveCheetah.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }})* (click to see).
