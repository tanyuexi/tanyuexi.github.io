## Highlights

+ Course project: [RollerMadness]({{ "/misc/20160308-IntroGameDevelRollerMadness/RollerMadness.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (use arrow keys to control), and [BoxShooter]({{ "/misc/20160308-IntroGameDevelBoxShooter/BoxShooter.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (use mouse and click to control). Both games were developed with Unity3D. Certificate: [Grade 96.7%](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/7UFBK5FCHMAR)

## Course information

[Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development) is given by Brian Winn, Associate Professor in Media and Information, Michigan State University. What's amazing is that by following all the video lectures, I can build fully functional games with Unity3D. Although I did not do much coding because the C# scripts were mostly provided by the course, I am now eager to learn more. Hope I can build a brand new game from scratch soon. **Highly recommended.**

I got a 96.7% grade (certificate [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/7UFBK5FCHMAR)), and you are welcomed to try my two games built in this course: 1) [RollerMadness]({{ "/misc/20160308-IntroGameDevelRollerMadness/RollerMadness.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}): use arrow keys to control, and 2) [BoxShooter]({{ "/misc/20160308-IntroGameDevelBoxShooter/BoxShooter.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}): use mouse and click to control.
