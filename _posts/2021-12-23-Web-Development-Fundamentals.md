## Overview of the Internet

Common Status Code returned by the server:

- 200: OK

- 301: Moved Permanently

- 404: Not Found

- 500: Internal Server Error

## How Do Browsers Work?

Steps:

1. Browser sends request for HTML file

2. After the server returns the HTML file, the browser searches elements in it for additional resources, and sends requests for them at the same time:

   - CSS stylesheets
   - assets like images and videos
   - JavaScript files

## Web 2.0

Web 1.0: static, meaning there is no user interaction other than jumping from one page to another. 

Web 2.0 was enabled by techniques like jQuery and web frameworks that connected to databases, like Spring, Django, and Ruby-on-Rails, enabled user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed:

- Offering content that responds to user input without forcing the page to reload. 
- Emphasizing user-generated content and social sharing.

## Current Internet Trends

Mobile internet traffic now accounts for more than half of all internet traffic and web development practices have evolved in order to provide a good user experience regardless of device type.
