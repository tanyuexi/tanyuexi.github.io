## Who am I? <br>我是谁？

My name is Yuexi Tan, or Alicia.  I was born in Nanning, a beautiful, quiet city in the far south of China. I am not good at numbers and memorizing. I love creative activities such as writing and programming. I often asked myself: "If there is God, what does he make me for?" <br>
我是谭月茜，英文名 Alicia。我出生在南宁，一个美丽宁静的中国南部城市。我不擅长数字和记忆。我热爱创造性工作，比如写作和编程。我时常问自己：“如果上帝存在的话，那么他造就我是为了做什么呢？”

## What do I do? <br>我做什么？

If there is God, then everything I experienced must mean something. So instead of asking others "what should I do", I searched my past for the thing which I felt the most profound yet imperfect. And it goes to **EDUCATION**. <br>
如果上帝存在，那么我所经历的一切都应该是有意义的。所以，我没有求问别人“我该做什么”，而是回想我的过去，寻找那些我认为最重要却又最不完美的事物。答案是，**教育**。

A typical case is a graduate course I took in 2013. Though the professor was trying hard to give as much as she could, I still felt a mess about the topic, nor did I have any interest in it. The information was piled up as unrelated pieces. This made me desperate because the course was provided by the best researcher in a nation-wide top university! In Chinese traditional thoughts, there is nothing wrong when learning is boring and tough. <br>
一个典型的例子是我在 2013 年听的一门研究生课。尽管那个教授在尽力地教，我仍然对其内容毫无头绪，更别提产生任何兴趣。那些信息仿佛是堆砌起来的互不相关的碎片。这令我十分绝望，因为这门课来自国内顶尖大学里最好的研究人员！中国传统观念认为，学习枯燥无味且困难重重是很正常的事。

To pass the course, I searched and found another course on the same topic given online by an Australian university. In that course, the same knowledge was organized in such careful way that I could see the whole picture of the field and be amazed by life. All the details became easy to remember because there was always a story behind them. "This is what a good course should be like!" Since then, I was deeply worried about the education quality in China. <br>
为了通过这门课的及格线，我搜寻且找到了另一门由澳大利亚的一所大学在线提供的、主题相同的课程。在这门课中，同样的知识被精心地组织起来，让我能够看到这个领域的大背景，并且为生命的魅力所惊叹。所有的细节都变得易于记忆，因为每个细节背后都有一个故事。“这才是一门好的课程应有的样子！”从此以后，我便为中国的教育质量感到十分担忧。

I see this phenomenon as the consequence of imperfect competition of education products, in the sense of economy. What interferes the perfect competition is that the information cannot flow freely, and people cannot choose freely. I think China's education faces three main problems: <br>
从经济学的角度来看，我认为这个现象是由教育产品的不充分竞争造成的。妨碍充分竞争的因素有两个：信息无法自由流通，人们无法自由选择。我认为中国的教育面临着三个主要问题：

1. **We do not have the best class in our country.** Chinese education is "famous" for its rigid approaches and score-driven mechanism. <br>
**国内没有最好的课程。**中国教育因僵化的方法和分数驱动的机制而“闻名于世”。

2. **We do not know what the best class looks like.** For most students, they have only one teacher for each subject. They do not know whether they are having a bad class. Even worse, they may get used to the bad classes and stop looking for better resource. <br>
**我们不知道好的课程该是什么样子。**对于大多数学生来说，他们每个科目只有一名授课老师。他们不知道自己是否接受了好的教育。更糟糕的是，他们可能会习惯糟糕的课程，不再寻找更好的资源。

3. **Even if we see a better class, we might not able to take it.** In the traditional classroom-teaching, resource is limited. Not everyone can access the best class. On the other hand, the chance that best classes of all subjects are in the same school is very small. <br>
**即使找到了一门好课，我们也很可能上不了。**在传统课堂教育中，资源是有限的。不是所有人都能进入最好的课堂。另一方面，所有科目的最好课程都集中在同一所学校的可能性很小。

The solution to Problem 1 seems to be "gamification". Problem 2 and 3 have been perfectly solved by massive open online courses (MOOC). However, I have not seen a product that brings the two solutions together. So this may be what I can do: gamified online education. <br>
问题 1 的解决方法似乎是“游戏化”。问题 2 和 3 已经被大规模在线公开课（MOOC）所解决。然而，我并没有看到一个将二者结合起来的产品。所以，这也许就是我能够投身的事业：游戏化在线教育。
