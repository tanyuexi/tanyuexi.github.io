## Who am I?

My name is Yuexi Tan.  I was born in Nanning, a beautiful, quiet city in the far south of China. I am emotional. I am not good at numbers and memorizing. I love creative activities such as writing and programming. I think slow, but deep. At the age of 9, I started to ask myself questions like "Am I still the same person if I was born a sencond later than the actual time?" and "Is it possible that there is a universe inside each atom, just like the one we have out here?"

I was educated in the traditional Chinese way. Luckily, I have great parents and teachers who never push me, therefore I had lots of time to explore the world. Since childhood, I spent hours and hours on watching documentaries about the nature, and I am amazed by life forms. So when I went to the college, I chose to study biology. After graduation, I entered several labs. However, they study only on the model species, and they care only about some boring molecular mechanisms, as if biology should be and can only be about these questions. So I realized that I will never have fun in current research paradigms of biology. I must do something else. I ask myself: "If there is God, then what does he make me for?"

## What do I do?

If there is God, then everything I experienced must mean something. So instead of asking others "what should I do", I searched my past for the thing which I felt the most profound yet imperfect. And it goes to **EDUCATION**. A typical case is the course I took in 2013 as a part of my PhD program. Though the professor was trying hard to give as much as she could, I still felt a mess about the topic, nor did I have any interest in it. The information was piled up as unrelated pieces. This made me desperate because the course was provided by the top university in China! In Chinese traditional thoughts, there is nothing wrong when learning is boring and tough. Then I found an online course on the same topic given by another university. In that course, the same knowledge was organized in such careful way that I could see the whole picture of the field and be amazed by life. All the details became easy to remember because there was always a story behind them. This is what a good course should be like. Since then, I was deeply worried about the education quality in China.

I see this phenomenon as the consequence of imperfect competition of education products, in the sense of economy. What interferes the perfect competition is that the information cannot flow freely, and people cannot choose freely. I think China's education faces three main problems:

1. **We do not have the best class in our country.** Chinese education is "famous" for its rigid approaches and score-driven mechanism.
2. **We do not know what the best class looks like.** For most students, they have only one teacher for each subject. They do not know whether they are having a bad class. And even worse, they may get used to the bad classes and stop looking for better resource.
3. **We cannot choose which class to take even if we see a better class.** In the traditional classroom-teaching, resource is limited. Not everyone can access the best class. And the chance that best classes of all subjects are in the same school is very small.

The solution to Problem 1 seems to be gamification. And Problem 2 and 3 have been perfectly solved by massive open online courses (MOOC). However, I have not seen a product that brings the two solutions together. So this may be what I can do: gamified online courses.
