<title>Words For Steven</title>
<body>
<h1>Hey Boss!</h1>
<p>Thanks for picking up my CV from the pile of others, so that I can get out of the messy house!</p>
<p>Thanks for being endlessly patient despite of my confused look.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a role model to which I will always refer by asking myself "what would Steven do".</p>
<p>Thanks for cleaning the mess behind us and cheering for us at the front.</p>
<p>Thanks for being the funniest and sweetest boss. At up time and down time. At all time.</p>
<p>Best wishes to you.</p>
<p>Tan</p>
