<h2 id="course-information">Course information</h2>

<p>The course <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript/">HTML, CSS and JavaScript</a></em> on Coursera was given by David Rossiter, Associate Professor of Engineering Education, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I once thought there is no need to open a course for subjects like HTML/CSS, as they are all about memorizing and practising. But by following this course and another course on R programming, I realized that a good course can not only save us a lot of time, but also provide with helpful tips from experienced engineers (the professor), which are hard to find anywhere else. The three assignments were carefully designed so that most points in the lecture were covered.</p>

<p>I achieved 100% grade in this course (certificate <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/ZXGE6ZVWH5N8">here</a>). My work for Assignment 3 is a game written in JavaScript: <em><a href="/misc/20160306-HtmlCssJsAssign3.html">Matching Game</a></em> (click to play). Have fun!</p>
