<h2 id="course-information">Course information</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development">Introduction to Game Development</a> is given by Brian Winn, Associate Professor in Media and Information, Michigan State University. Whatâ€™s amazing is that by following all the video lectures, I can build fully functional games with Unity3D. Although I did not do much coding because the C# scripts were mostly provided by the course, I am now eager to learn more. Hope I can build a brand new game from scratch soon. <strong>Highly recommended.</strong></p>

<p>I got a 96.7% grade (certificate <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/7UFBK5FCHMAR">here</a>), and you are welcomed to try my two games built in this course: 1) <a href="/misc/20160308-IntroGameDevelRollerMadness/RollerMadness.html">RollerMadness</a>: use arrow keys to control, and 2) <a href="/misc/20160308-IntroGameDevelBoxShooter/BoxShooter.html">BoxShooter</a>: use mouse and click to control.</p>
